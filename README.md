# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks
This repository organizes the projects that I have conducted in QBS 181: Data Wrangling. I have been given the permission to make the work public.

## Project 1
The Project 1 folder contains the SQL code for Homework 1 in which I wrangle data to rename and create columns based on various conditions and intervals. 

## Project 2
Project 2 contains R code which connects to the SQL server using ODBC Connect. The code manipulates the Phonecall Encounter, Call Duration, Demographics, Conditions, and TextMessages datasets through conditional statements, merges, filters, among others.

## Project 3
Project 3 includes the R code in which I work with data for TB cases by population to test hypotheses, generate visualizations, and extract data using Twitter API.

## Midterm Project
The midterm project uses raw data on diabetes from NHANES. I clean the data before further use and explore significant problems within the data. I further address various  data-related issues through the code included.  

## Final Project
The final project uses a blood pressure dataset with the Demographics, Conditions, and Text datasets to not only tidy the data but also recode, merge, and explore the data in SQL. The code for the second question is repeated in R. Questions #1a, 1b, 1c, and 2 are executed in SQL, and questions #1d, 1e, 1f, and 3 are in R.
